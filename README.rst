Instructions
------------

In a new command prompt session, run:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"

Changing the path above to wherever your favorite vcvarsall.bat happens to live.

Then cd into each directory and run the batch files. These files are pretty
simple and stupid and expect to be run from their directories.
